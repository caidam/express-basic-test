### Install test tools

1. create a new branch

```bash
git switch -c quest_2.1_test
```

2. install `jest`, the test framework
https://jestjs.io/fr/

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest
```

3. install `supertest` library
https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest

abstraction layer on tests.

```bash
npm install --save-dev supertest
```

4. modify `package.json` accordingly

```json
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js",
    "dev": "nodemon index.js",
    "test": "jest"
  },
```

### File organization, best practice

1. Server structure

No need to run server on `localhost:PORT` when running test, we just need the routes.
`.listen()` is used to receive requests from outside, thus we first need to dissociate our app from `listen()` by creating an `app.js` file next to the `index.js` one.

2. Isolate app

`app.js` is a copy of `index.js` without the `PORT` and `app.listen()` portion.

3. Update `index.js`

In `index.js` delete all the content that we kept in `app.js` and add `require` on top.

```js
const app = require('./app');

const port = 5000;

app
  .listen(port, () => {
    console.info(`Server is listening on port ${port}`);
  })
  .on("error", (err) => {
    console.error("Error:", err.message);
  });
```

4. Test

Test everything runs smoothly by running `npm run dev`

make sure to add `module.exports = app;` in your `app.js` file


### Further preparation

1. Create a `test` folder

2. Create a `movies.test.js` file in it

> naming is important here. `movies` refers to the portion of the code tested, `test` tells jest to execute the file when calling `npm run test`, `js` is the file extension

3. import `supertest` and `app` in the new file

```js
const request = require("supertest");
const app = require("../app");
```

### Write and run tests

1. refer to `movies.test.js` to see tests syntax

2. run tests with `npm run test`
